The Vera C. Rubin Observatory construction project involves assembly, integration, and verification testing phases.  Prior to the installation of the 3.2 Gpix LSSTCam, the Rubin Observatory Commissioning Camera (ComCam) will test the functionality and performance of the telescope, facility, and various software and DM/IT infrastructural components, although at a smaller scale than the final LSSTCam configuration which immediately follows this inital 3 month on-sky campaign.  During this time, the ComCam observations will verify most of the camera interfaces as well as demonstrate the performance of the Simonyi Telescope Active Optics System.
